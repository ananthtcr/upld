                   <h2 id="brief-description">Brief Description</h2>
                   <p>Fine Uploader aims to make file-uploading on the web possible in every browser and mobile device. It is cross-browser, dependency-free, and 100% JavaScript. The product is highly customizable, and allows integrators to fine-tune every aspect of their users’ upload experience. Implementation requires only a single CSS file, a JavaScript file, and a server to upload to. Fine Uploader users enjoy widespread browser support and a suite of features, resulting in a smooth experience when uploading files to a website.
                   </p>
                   <p>Fine Uploader is sponsored by <a href="http://www.widen.com">Widen Enterprises</a> and ongoing development is led by <a href="https://github.com/rnicholus" target="_blank">Ray Nicholus</a> and the rest of the community.

                   <h2 id="history">History</h2>

                   <p>Fine Uploader originally existed as file-uploader, and has also been known as valums/file-uploader (due to its location on GitHub).</p>
                   <p>Andrew Valums created file-uploader in 2010 as an improved version of “ajax-uploader”, also hosted on GitHub as a free open source project.</p>
                   <p>In August 2012, Andrew handed the project over to Ray Nicholus, and Ray has been maintaining and evolving this library since 2.0, when it was renamed Fine Uploader.</p>
                   <p>In March 2013, Widen Enterprises took over the development and management of Fine Uploader, with Ray Nicholus continuing as lead developer.</p>

                   <h2 id="future">Future Outlook</h2>
                   <p>Since sponsorship of the project was transferred to Widen Enterprises, Fine Uploader has continued to evolve into the web’s finest tool for uploading from the browser.
                       Having the backing of an established company such as Widen means developers can continue adding more features to the product, draw on the wealth of resources provided
                       by Widen, and ensure the stability of the product for the future. The fact that Fine Uploader is tightly integrated with other Widen products means that Fine Uploader
                       will not be going away anytime soon. In fact, there are big things planned for the future! The Fine Uploader community is happily hacking away at the next great set of features.
                   </p>

                   <p>If you can’t tell already, we are all <em>really</em> excited about the future of Fine Uploader.</p>
